# Icon Note

The extension includes an SVG icon (`icon128.svg`). For the extension to work properly in Chrome/Edge, you need PNG versions of the icons.

## Quick Fix

You can either:

1. **Use online converter**: Convert `icon128.svg` to PNG at https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
   - Create 3 sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
   - Save as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

2. **Use any image editor** (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.):
   - Open the SVG
   - Export as PNG in the required sizes

3. **Temporary workaround**: Comment out the `icons` section in `manifest.json` to test without icons

## Or Use Simple Placeholder

Create simple colored squares as temporary icons:
- 16x16 purple square → `icon16.png`
- 48x48 purple square → `icon48.png`
- 128x128 purple square → `icon128.png`

The extension will work fine without icons, they're just for visual appeal!
