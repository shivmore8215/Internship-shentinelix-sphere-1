## Note About Icons

The extension currently uses placeholder icons. For a production version, you would add:

- `icons/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these using any image editor with a shield/clipboard design.

## Troubleshooting

**Extension won't load?**
- Make sure you selected the `NoHijacking` folder (not a parent folder)
- Check that all files are present

**Not detecting hijacking?**
- Make sure you're on a webpage (not chrome:// pages)
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh the page after installing

**No notifications?**
- Check browser notification permissions
- Look for on-page alerts instead
